# Why the Foundation television adaptation was not good:
## Main Issue
Demerzel.
Yes, that side character. Why care? Because Demerzel is a robot. In the book, he follows the three laws of robotics, which are one of the most famous things Isaac Asimov made.
> 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
> 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
> 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
Demerzel also follows the Zeroth Law, which takes priority over the First Law, and is basically the same as the First Law except "humanity" replaces "a human being".

Why are the laws so important? Because in the show, Demerzel _kills someone_. Not only that - several someones! Robots _cannot_ kill human beings without their brains melting. Granted, he could theoretically kill someone thanks to the Zeroth Law if doing so was what was best for humanity. However, that is not the justification used in the show. 

Instance 1: Demerezel tells the first victim that the emperor, who Demerzel works for as an advisor, ordered her death. Demerzel didn't want to do it, the emperor was forcing a robot to kill. The Second Law does not supercede the First. Demerzel could have justified it by saying something - anything - about how this woman had to die for the survival of humanity or something. 

Instance 2: Demerzel straight up kills the heir to the throne because his genetics were tampered with. This murder was not verbally justified by Demerzel or anyone else, but can be more easily implied to be for the good of the empire. Mostly this murder was just painful because he was actually a decent person, unlike the rest of the emperial dynasty. 

Even "I, Robot" which was a movie kinda inspired by the collection of short stories by the same name and the Robot Series (both by Asimov) handled the Laws better. The movie had robot try to kill humanity and whatnot but at least it acknowledged the Laws and gave a reason for the killing. They could have used a better reason, but at least they had one.

## Secondary Issue
So, so much was changed with plot, characters, the empire, technology, etc. Some of this is understandable as the books would, truthfully, make a horrible show on their own. They simply aren't set up for it. However, so much was changed that the show is practically unrecognizable beyond character names and rough plot points. 

So yeah, sorry about that. Probably not what was expected in a page created specifically because of a school assignment. The instructions were vague as to what contents to include.
